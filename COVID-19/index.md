Johns Hopkins University posts COVID-19 data daily [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) (as of February 2020). I wrote an open source program to download the data, filter and aggregate, and then store in a format that is convenient for analysis using tools like [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft/excel) or [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).

Here are two video tutorials on how to retrieve the data and perform your own analysis:

* [Retrieve and Analyze COVID-19 Data using Microsoft Excel](https://youtu.be/W-NF39ttIr4)
* [Retrieve and Analyze COVID-19 Data using Tableau](https://youtu.be/T1q-e_KaEBg)

The program and information are [On Github Here](https://github.com/FileMeta/ReadAndConvertCovid19Data) and you can download the executable [Here](https://github.com/FileMeta/ReadAndConvertCovid19Data/releases).

The video tutorials are the best way to get started. You can view the help file for the program by [downloading it](https://github.com/FileMeta/ReadAndConvertCovid19Data/releases) and running the following command line:

```
ReadAndConvertCovid19Data -h
```
