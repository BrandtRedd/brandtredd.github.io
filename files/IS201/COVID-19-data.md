This is a dataset collected by Johns Hopkins University that represents confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, deaths due to the virus, and recovered cases.

* Download the dataset: [COVID-19-Time-Series-csse.csv](/files/IS201/COVID-19-Time-Series-csse.csv)
* Updated: 13 March 2020

As of 13 March 2020, they post new data daily at the [2019 Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 (2019-nCoV) Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) on GitHub.

I wrote a small open source tool, [ReadAndConvertCovid19Data](https://github.com/FileMeta/ReadAndConvertCovid19Data) to convert the data a format that is more convenient for analysis using [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft/excel) or [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/). That is the version of the data posted above.
